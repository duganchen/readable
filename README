Readable CMS-targed Wordpress theme.

This is the theme used by Dugan Chen's homepage. It does not support comments.

Before using it, you need to add files from two other projects:

1. HTML 5 Reset Stylesheet:
http://html5doctor.com/html-5-reset-stylesheet/

Save it as readable/css/reset.css

2. jQuery lightBox plugin
http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/

I'm going to assume that the current version is 0.5. Unzip it, then do the following:

2a. Copy lightbox/css/jquery.lightbox-0.5.css to
readable/css/jquery.lightbox.css

2b. Copy lightbox/js/jquery.lightbox-0.5.min.js to
readable/css/jquery.lightbox.min.js

2c. Copy lightbox/images/ to readable/images/
